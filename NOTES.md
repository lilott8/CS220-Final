##NOTES

The controller will be how we abstract the logic from the main and thus the entire framework.

The flow of the program will then be: main->controller->map & algorithm

##TODO

 - add error handling for the placement of pins
 - Either add all the appropriate .o files to the make file or convince Brian to use CMake!
